## Project Overview
This repository contains a web page project that I developed for practice and to enhance my coding skills. The project is based on a tutorial by [Codehal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1GmFCGuVjw&ab_channel=Codehal) on YouTube. The primary purpose of this project is educational, focusing on the application and understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Learning Objectives
- **JavaScript Introduction**: This project marks my first hands-on experience with JavaScript, allowing me to explore basic functionalities and interactivity in web development.
- **Navbar Proficiency**: I've been improving my skills in creating navigation bars, and this project helped me solidify my understanding and implementation techniques.
- **CSS Clarity**: My proficiency in CSS has significantly improved, and this project was an excellent opportunity to apply various styling concepts more confidently.
- **Issue Identification and Resolution**: I encountered a minor issue with the email input section, which I plan to investigate and resolve shortly. This will be updated in the project as part of my continuous learning process.
